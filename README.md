Video Conference 
  Video conferencing refers to any live video communication between two or more parties in two or more separate locations. These video connections generally include live audio and text as well. Video conferencing can run the gamut of technological complexity from static images accompanied by text to high-quality video and audio. The simplest versions can only connect two locations, but the more sophisticated versions can provide transmission between three or more locations at once.

Functional Requirements:

  The system shall support organization of meetings and determine, for each meeting request, a meeting date and location so that most of the intended participants will effectively participate.
The system shall monitor meetings, especially when they are held in a distributed manner or periodically; 
The web shall plan meetings under the constraints expressed by participants 
The web shall manage all the interactions among participants required during the organization of the meeting.
For helping with conflict resolution and negotiation support, video conferencing should be available on the system and each video conferencing session should be recorded and analyzed for the purpose of monitoring. 


Non Functional Requirements:

01. Security: Meeting locations should be convenient, and information about meetings should be secure.

02. Compatibility: Re-planning of a meeting should be done as dynamically and with as much flexibility as possible;The system should be flexible enough to accommodate evolving data.
